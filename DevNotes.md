[DevBlog:3/1/26]
- Metrics: whtie background, avoid cards, add dynamic annimations/graphs or charts.
- FeatureGrid: Match landing page /w graphcs.
- Testimonials: Width Issue, try find a way to make them non-uniform so they appear more dynamically.
- Certifications: Should be more impactful, glowing, and meaningful (using annimations and visual effects) they're accolades, symbols of achievement, and make you stand out.
- Hero: It should be informative, engaging, and original, but without competing with the landing page. Experiment with unique variations.
